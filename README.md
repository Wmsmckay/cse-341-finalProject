Project workflow:
[Workflow example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhtbhSpV5YA)
- Pull the changes from the remote repo to your local machines `git pull`
- Pick a task to work on in the Projects tab on Github [Project Board](https://github.com/users/Wmsmckay/projects/2/views/1)
- Move the task from Backlog to In Progress 
- Create a new branch on your local repo with your initials and what the task is called `initials--task-title` (So if I was working on the 'create GET route' task, it would be `mw--create-get-route`)
- Make the changes on your branch to implement the task and commit them
- Push your changes to GitHub and create a pull request for your branch
- Notify the team that your task has been completed so that someone can look at the pull request and merge the code in.
- Repeat
